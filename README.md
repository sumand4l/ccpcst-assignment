## âš™ Installation and Run

- For C/C++
  - If you're Windows user you can use [Dev-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/) or any other C/C++ Compilers out there.
  - And If you're Linux fanboy there is legendary [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) compiler which comes pre-installed with pretty much every Linux distro.
    - Compile and Run
      ```
      $ gcc -o file_name file_name.c //for C
      $ ./file_name
      $ g++ -o file_name file_name.cpp // for C++
      $ ./file_name
      ```
- For Java
  - **Windows**: For Java installation my suggestion will be [Azul's Zulu JDKs](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk)
  - **Linux**: [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/install/) is there
    - Compile and Run
      ```
        $ javac file_name.java
        $ java file_name
      ```
- For LaTeX (Optional)

  - Since I used Latex to prepare assignment documentation, I'm adding this section too.

    So, What is LaTex basically ?

    - LaTex is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing like thesis, report, article, balance sheet etc.

  - **Windows**: [Click here](https://www.latexbuch.de/install-latex-windows/) for installation guide

  - **Linux**: In various Linux distribution `texlive` is a very popular Latex package.
    - For Ubuntu users simply install
      ```
      sudo apt install texlive-latex-extra
      ```
    - Compilation: This command will compile your `.tex` file to `.pdf` docs
      ```
       pdflatex file_name.tex
      ```
    - You may use Latex editor like TeXstudio - [Click here](https://linuxhint.com/install-texstudio-latex-editor-linux/)
